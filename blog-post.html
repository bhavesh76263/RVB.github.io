                <h2>Park Party Time!</h2>
                <p><strong>When:</strong> March 20, 2025</p>
                <p>Hiya! Daddy here, spilling the beans for Lily. We zoomed to the park today, and WHOA, it was a blast! Lily bounced around like a kangaroo, chasing bubbles and yelling “WHEEEE!” at the swings. She even made a muddy masterpiece with her boots—oopsie!</p>
                <p>We munched on gooey peanut butter sammies and danced with some sneaky squirrels. Lily says this planet is “super-duper fun,” and I’m just here soaking up her giggles. More wild stuff coming soon!</p>
